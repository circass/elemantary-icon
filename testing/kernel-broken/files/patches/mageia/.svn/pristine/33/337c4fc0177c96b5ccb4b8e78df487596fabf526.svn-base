	      Building kernel packages from the svn checkout
	      ==============================================

1. For the impatient
====================

$ svn co svn+ssh://svn.mageia.org/svn/packages/cauldron/kernel/current
$ cd current
$ ./build_sources
$ bm -l

NOTE: this will build ALL the kernel packages.

2. Detailed explanation
=======================

2.1 build_sources script
------------------------

Mageia kernel packages don't use the standard RPM's way of applying
and managing patches.

Instead, the build script expects a specific tarball to exist.

That tarball contains the .config files, patches and other scripts used
by the build process.

The tarball is created by the build_sources script. You must run it
before the actual kernel build.

2.2 bm
------

The bm script is a front-end for the rpm program. bm makes life a lot
easier. If you don't have it installed run:

# urpmi bm

To build all the kernel packages, you can run (in the checkout directory):

$ bm -l

But that will build all the kernel packages, for i586 for example,
there're 20 of them.

To disable the build of a specific package, you can use the --without
flag, for example:

$ bm -l --without server

Won't build the laptop kernel package and its -devel version.

Please, take a look at the spec in order to know what can be disabled and
what can't.
