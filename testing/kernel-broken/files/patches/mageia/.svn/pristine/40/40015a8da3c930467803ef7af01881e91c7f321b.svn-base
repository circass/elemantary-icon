		  Managing Mageia kernel patches
                  ==============================

1. Introduction
===============

Mageia kernel package doesn't use the standard RPM way of managing
patches, which would be to list the patches using the 'Patch' keyword
and then apply them at '%prep' stage using '%patch' commands.

Instead, we use a tool called quilt.

The reason is that the ancients found that it's very easier and simpler
to manage patches with quilt than to use RPM's standard way (which sucks,
let's be honest here).

This document doesn't explain how quilt work, if you don't know how to
use it, please read:

2. Creating the kernel tree
===========================

In order to start working with the patches, you must create the
kernel tree properly.

You can use the create_quilt_tree script to do that, it's under the
PATCHES/scripts/ directory. Suppose you're in the SOURCES directory,
you do:

$ ../PATCHES/scripts/create_quilt_tree -f linux-2.6.24.tar.bz2

And it'll take care of creating the tree for you.

3. Adding and removing patches
==============================

The nice about quilt is that: there isn't anything special about
adding or removing patches from the tree.

This section explains how it's done.

3.1 Adding a new patch
----------------------

First off, you have to go to the right position in the stack where the
new patch will be added. For example, I want to add a new sound patch and
I want it on the top of the sound patches, so I do:

$ quilt applied | egrep '^sound-'
sound-alsa-1.0.16rc1.patch
sound-sigmatel_audio_display_all_controls_when_subsystem_id_is_wrong.patch
sound-sigmatel_audio_fix_macbook_v2.patch

Ok. The top of the sound stack is sound-sigmatel_audio_fix_macbook_v2.patch,
let's go there to apply the new patch on top of it:

$ quilt pop sound-sigmatel_audio_fix_macbook_v2.patch

Now, just import the new patch:

$ quilt import /tmp/sound-fix-issues.patch
$ quilt push -a

Compile. Test. Etc. Don't forget to commit when you're done:

$ cd ../../     < go to the checkout's top dir>
$ svn st
?      SOURCES/linux-2.6.24
?      PATCHES/patches/sound-fix-issues.patch
M      PATCHES/patches/series
$ svn add PATCHES/patches/sound-fix-issues.patch
A         PATCHES/patches/sound-fix-issues.patch
$ vim SPECS/kernel.spec   < changelog info >
$ svn commit

3.2 Removing a patch
--------------------

The simplest way of removing a patch is straightforward. Suppose your
tree is already created (step 2) and you're in it, just do:

$ quilt delete < patch to remove >
$ svn del patches/<patch to remove>

Changelog. Commit. You're done.
