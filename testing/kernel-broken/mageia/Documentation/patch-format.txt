		   Mageia kernel patch format
                   ==========================

1. Patch contents format
========================

The patch format used by Mandriva's kernel is fully desribed at:

	http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/tpp.txt

In short, each patch must have the following information (in
this exact order):

	1. One line which describes the patch briefly (about 50 chars)
	2. Changelog (what does the patch do? Why?)
	3. Author's Signed-off-by line

2. Patch file name
==================

The name of the patch file is also important, the rule is simple: just
prepend the subsystem name. Examples: vfs- , mm- , video- etc...

3. Examples
===========

The directory PATCHES/patches has a lot of good examples (and some bad
ones as well).
